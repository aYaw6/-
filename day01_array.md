## Binary Search
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1

```java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        if (target < nums[0] || target > nums[nums.length - 1]) {
            return -1;
        }
        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + ((right - left) >> 1);
            if (nums[mid] == target)
                return mid;
            else if (nums[mid] < target)
                left = mid + 1;
            else if (nums[mid] > target)
                right = mid - 1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Remove Element
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
- Return k.

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        // 快慢指针
        int slowIndex = 0;
        for (int fastIndex = 0; fastIndex < nums.length; fastIndex++) {
            if (nums[fastIndex] != val) {
                nums[slowIndex] = nums[fastIndex];
                slowIndex++;
            }
        }
        return slowIndex;
    }
}
```
